# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview
The following is an analysis of precipation and temperature data for Oahu, Hawaii between the years 2010 and 2017. The analysis takes a deeper look and comparison between the months June and December to determine key differences that may affect tourism and the success and longevity of a business in this area.

## Resources
- Data Source: Data collected from weather stations in Oahu, Hawaii

## Findings
Based on plotting of precipitation data (See: Analysis folder for June and December weather plot and statistics images for comparison) there was not a vast difference in the amount and frequency in precipitation. December's average precipiation is about 38% higher than June's average. The biggest difference is in the temperature. June temperature ranges stay between 70 to 80 degrees. Decemeber stays cooler with a range of about 68 to 75 degrees. Considering the rest of the United States experiences temperatures much lower than Oahu's averages, those seeking respite from colder temps may see Oahu as an option for a winter vacation. Overall comparison of June and December weather averages suggest that this would be an ideal spot for tourism year-round.

## Additional recommendations for further analysis
The data gathered so far gives a solid foundation to explore further the weather patterns of Oahu. In order to move forward with a decision to open business in Oahu, there are other factors to take into consideration to determine the perfect spot to open up shop. I would suggest to compare the temperature and precipitation data from each weather station individually. There may be parts of the island that expereince more or less rain than others and determining the orientation of the specific station may give insight into the perfect location. Also, it would be a good idea to look at the concentration of surf shops and ice cream shops in potential areas, though this is a unique idea, I believe seeking locations that are not over-saturated with these businesses would add to the potential for success. One last suggestion for further analysis would be to obtain further data on tide patterns for waves. Opening up a surf shop in a area that sees to small or too large of waves could deter traffic from surfers of certain experience levels.
